          <h2>Did you know that more than 80% of job openings are not posted? </h2>

          <p>(Translation: If your job-hunting strategy is to apply for jobs online, you’re only reaching 20% of the job market, if that.)</p>

          <p>Worse, when you apply for a position in that 20% category, talent software often screens HALF of the incoming applications before they make it to a real person!</p>

          <p>It’s no wonder creating your dream career is harder than ever. </p>

          <p>The good news is: it doesn’t have to be. </p>
