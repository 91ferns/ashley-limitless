Not only was I not getting the job, I was not even getting the interview! (And I thought my resume and cover letter were spotless, so I couldn't imagine why I wasn't getting any calls.) I knew the way I was headed in my career no longer suited me and my needs, but I didn't know how to re-route my journey without losing precious time.</p>

        <p>After working with Ashley, I was able to learn new skills – or re-vamp existing ones – that made me feel confident in my resume and experience.  Ashley helped me get clear about where my talents would be most effective, and map out a variety of paths to get me to the most desired result. This led to SEVERAL interviews (and a few offers!) in the first month. </p>

        <p>Ashley is so passionate about what she does and I really felt like she genuinely wanted to help me. I am so excited for future participants!”</p>

    <h2>FROM UNDERPAID ADMIN ASSISTANT TO MULTIPLE JOB OFFERS IN 6 WEEKS</h2>

    <div class="content">

      <h3 class="felthat">(My Story)</h3>

      <p>I remember it like it was yesterday…</p>

      <p>After years of preparation for my dream job in counter-terrorism – which included mastering TWO foreign languages and earning my master’s degree at one of the top 20 educational institutions in the world – I returned home to Los Angeles and began searching for employment.</p>

      <p><strong>And landed… a dead-end admin position. How could this happen??</strong></p>

      <p>I had done everything “right.” </p>

      <p>How was it that I couldn’t even manage to get a job in my desired industry – let alone something that reflected the level of education and experience I’d spent years working so hard for? Every day in my first job was spent ordering cupcakes for office parties and processing travel expenses for executives’ exciting business trips to locations I never thought I’d get to see.</p>

      <p class="lead">I was in such FEAR that I would never live my purpose – or be the woman I truly wanted to be – that I could hardly even hear the persistent whisper in the back of my head telling me I was meant for more…</p>

      <p>I let that cubicle drag me to the depths of despair because I didn’t know HOW or IF I could actually find something better.</p>

      <p>Most of all, I was scared it just wouldn’t happen for me. I felt hopeless.</p>

      <h2 class="felthat">Fast forward a few years ...</h2>

      <p>Since that day, I have managed a high-level program for the Pentagon (yes, I did go on to land that “dream job” … (more on that shortly), I have spoken on stages such as TEDxBerkeley, and I have been featured in dozens of publications and TV programs, including:</p>

      <p><img class="aligncenter" alt="Forbes and more" src="<?php ashley_limitless_image('content-portfolio.png'); ?>"></p>

      <p>I’ve helped hundreds of 20 and 30somethings men and women around the country <strong>land their dream jobs</strong> (even in cities or countries they’ve never visited before!), <strong>negotiate salary bumps</strong>, and <strong>make career changes</strong> that are in alignment with who they really are. </p>

      <p>Best of all, I LOVE what I do. </p>

    <h2 class="felthat text-center">So what changed?</h2>

    <div class="content">

      <p>How did I go from feeling stuck in a dead-end job with no opportunities in sight, to working as one of the youngest management professionals for the Pentagon, to passionate career coach and entrepreneur in just a few short years?</p>

      <p><strong>It all began with a choice.</strong></p>

      <p>After months of feeling miserable and going through more pints of Ben & Jerry’s than I care to admit, I finally decided to do whatever it took to make a change. </p>

      <p>I quit my dead-end job in LA and moved to Washington, D.C. (with zero job prospects and zero professional contacts). </p>

      <p>In the span of 6 weeks, I went to 90 events, had coffee with 200 people, and landed 3 job offers.  </p>

      <p><strong>I accepted my dream job at the Pentagon, which meant thatI went from an executive assistant to executive… All in one job-hunt.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Not to mention, I tripled my salary.</strong></p>

      <p>I thought I was set for life. </p>

      <p><strong>Finally, all my hard work had paid off.</strong></p>

      <h2 class="felthat">Something was still missing ...</h2>

      <p>I didn’t want to admit it to myself, but after the initial glow of my new salary and sparkly D.C. life began to fade, it slowly dawned on me that the dream I had pursued for so long <strong>might not be the best fit for me after all.</strong></p>

      <p>At first, it was the pervasive culture of paternalism and sexism that got under my skin – but getting hit on by my much-older coworkers was a manageable annoyance.</p>

      <p>It was my unexpected fear of bloodshed that soon became the bigger problem.</p>

      <p>How was I going to be a spy, if I couldn’t even hold a gun?!</p>

      <p>This sent me into a tailspin...</p>

      <p><strong>I remember feeling like my <u>career</u>, my <u>passion</u> and my <u>identity</u> were all in conflict with one another.</strong></p>

      <p>More than anything, I felt completely alone. </p>

      <p>Turns out, I wasn’t alone at all. In fact…</p>

      <p>75% of the U.S. population is hiding some part of their identity at work (Reuters). </p>

      <p>I tried to stick it out. </p>

      <h2 class="felthat">It got to the point where every day in my job felt like a <span class="ashley">waste of time.</span></h2>

      <ul>
        <li>I was scared and hopeless that I would never find my purpose in the workforce. </li>

        <li>I worried that I would spend my entire life counting down to Fridays, never finding a career that 						energized and excited me. </li>

        <li>I was overwhelmed and upset by the idea of letting life happen to me, just taking jobs just because I 						“should take what I can get,” 	or because I didn’t really know what I wanted.</li>

        <li>I knew deep down inside that I was just holding onto my “plan” for the sake of having one.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I tried talking to friends about my predicament, but somehow the conversation always turned back to them and their careers. </p>

      <p><strong>Everyone, it seemed, was experiencing a crisis of their own</strong> – and they wanted to know how I’d managed to triple my income, land so many interviews, and become so efficient at networking. </p>

      <h2>I DIDN’T KNOW IT AT THE TIME, BUT<br>MY NEW PATH AS A CAREER<br>COACH HAD JUST BEGUN.</h2>

      <p>Pretty soon, my friends were asking if they could bring their friends along to our coffee dates or weekend brunches.</p>

      <p>Instead of talking about bad dates or annoying roommates, we would map out how they were going to find their purpose, make a career pivot, network their way into job interviews, land more job offers, and negotiate a new salary. </p>

      <p>I’ll never forget the day I arrived at Starbucks to meet a friend, and she was accompanied by no less than eight of her friends – all of them crammed around a tiny table.</p>

      <p>“They heard you help people get results,” she said, by way of explanation.</p>

      <p>I faced the music, and I quit my job in D.C. Next, I moved home to L.A. The fear and uncertainty I’d been dodging for so long caught up with me, and I felt like a complete failure.</p>

      <p>After spending way too many nights up late researching career options, I knew I needed to take <u>massive action</u>, so I borrowed money to hire a life coach who empowered me to move forward.</p>

      <p><strong>It was a life-changing decision.</strong></p>

      <p>She helped me overcome the emotional hangover I felt from realizing that my dream job wasn’t so dreamy. More importantly, she helped me recover the confidence and clarity I’d lost along the way.</p>

      <p>“What lights you up?” she asked me.</p>

      <p>I reflected on the weeks in DC I spent as a job hunting and job-hopping master, and realized that it was the thrill of the hunt – not the job itself – that lit me up and made me come alive. </p>

      <p>I truly loved job hunting and helping people find their purpose… </p>

      <p>(And I always had a knack for it.)</p>

      <p>I loved networking, rebranding my resume, negotiating for my salaries, and helping other people find their purpose and dream jobs. </p>

      <p>Most of all, I loved feeling like I had job security. I became so great at networking that I realized I’d never worry about my career again—I was always an email away from another job offer. </p>

      <p><strong>When I realized this, I finally had the power to eliminate the doubts that held me back so that I could step into my true purpose (helping YOU embrace yours).</strong></p>

        <p>Before working with Ashley in the Limitless Career Lab, I was unsatisfied in the retail jobs I worked, but unable to move out of these fields. I was supporting my filmmaking work out of pocket, and not able to get a job in my field despite having a BFA in film and a certificate in Digital Filmmaking. Most of all, I was your typical disenfranchised millennial.</p>

        <p>After joining Ashley’s program, I was employed in the entertainment industry working regular office hours- two things I previously thought were incompatible! I also become very aware of an incredible number of opportunities in my field- truly a mindset of abundance, and I no longer feel trapped in my current role. I am now using my education, my talents, and working a job that I can honestly say I love.</p>

        <p>I'm so glad I did this because Ashley's tips have stayed with me far beyond the course, and have helped me not only in securing employment, but in my personal artistic endeavors as well.  Her networking and job-hunting tips are timeless, but the course itself was highly tailored to my individual needs at the time.  She helped me get past a huge professional block, and my career has soared since taking the course.  I can't recommend her enough!</p>
