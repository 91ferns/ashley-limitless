          <h2>Did you know that more than 80% of job openings are not posted? </h2>

          <p>(Translation: If your job-hunting strategy is to apply for jobs online, you’re only reaching 20% of the job market, if that.)</p>

          <p>Worse, when you apply for a position in that 20% category, talent software often screens HALF of the incoming applications before they make it to a real person!</p>

          <p>It’s no wonder creating your dream career is harder than ever. </p>

          <p>The good news is: it doesn’t have to be. </p>

        <p>“I am so glad I participated in Limitless Career Lab, because I was lost on my own – nothing I did was working for me.  Not only was I not getting the job, I was not even getting the interview! (And I thought my resume and cover letter were spotless, so I couldn't imagine why I wasn't getting any calls.) I knew the way I was headed in my career no longer suited me and my needs, but I didn't know how to re-route my journey without losing precious time.</p>

        <p>After working with Ashley, I was able to learn new skills – or re-vamp existing ones – that made me feel confident in my resume and experience.  Ashley helped me get clear about where my talents would be most effective, and map out a variety of paths to get me to the most desired result. This led to SEVERAL interviews (and a few offers!) in the first month. </p>

        <p>Ashley is so passionate about what she does and I really felt like she genuinely wanted to help me. I am so excited for future participants!”</p>

      <p>It’s about being a parent who can provide for your family, or a career person who makes positive change in the world by playing BIG (and inspiring others to do the same).</p>

      <p>It’s about becoming the <u>successful, empowered, confident person</u> you know you were meant to be. </p>

      <p>Here’s the deal: confidence comes from knowledge. </p>

      <p><strong>Every day I see highly competent people lose confidence in themselves because they don’t know how to get job offers.</strong></p>

      <p>I’m here to remedy that. </p>

        <p>“Before working with Ashley, I was confused, unable to commit to a decision, and un-focused. After working with Ashley, I was clear on what I wanted (and deserved) and clear on how to make my goals happen with attainable actions and focus.</p>

        <p>I'm so glad I completed the Limitless Career Lab because without Ashley I would not be even close to the clarity and focus I have now. Ash has helped me find my place in the world and most importantly, she upgraded my beliefs about myself. Her energy and passion for servicing others is inspiring.
